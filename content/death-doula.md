## The Role of a Death Doula

A death doula does not arrive to take over. We are not here to fix, rescue, or replace.

We come to tend the space-to hold what is heavy, to soften what is sharp, to make room for love to lead.
We walk beside the dying one and their kin, offering calm presence, gentle guidance, and sacred structure
so that family can simply be-as raw, real, tender, or still as they need to be.

In the sacred threshold of dying, we are the lantern-bearers, the ones who remember that this, too, is a ceremony.

> You are not expected to know how.  
> You are held, just as you are.

Death is not the end.
It is a return. A passage. A sacred crossing.

As a death doula, I walk beside those nearing the death threshold, offering presence, ritual, love and remembrance to make the leaving as sacred as the arriving.

Just as we honor the beginning of life with ceremony, touch, and prayer
-so too should we honor the end.

This is soul work.
This is death as initiation.
This is care for the one departing, and for those who remain here.

## My Offer To You

My presence is gentle, rooted, and responsive to the needs of each person; body, heart mind and soul.

Whether you or your loved one is actively dying, navigating a terminal diagnosis, or seeking support in advance planning, I hold space with reverence and respect.

Together, we create a soft, sacred container for death. Not clinical, not rushed, not erased.

## End-of-Life Doula Support May Include

- Vigil sitting - holding space in the days or hours before death
- Ritual and ceremony creation - ancestral, elemental, or spiritual (tailored to beliefs)
- Emotional + energetic support for the dying and their loved ones
- Legacy projects - storytelling, recordings, memory bundles, altar work
- Advance care planning and death mapping
- After-death guidance, for body care, home vigils, funerals, and home altars
- Grief support + grounding for family and close friends

#### Each journey is unique. You may need a one-time session or a full, ongoing presence.
#### I work intuitively, practically, and with deep compassion.

This Is For You If:

- You want death to be sacred, not sterile
- You are dying, or supporting someone who is, and seek spiritual grounding
- You wish to bring ritual, music, prayer, or presence into the finaldays
- You need help navigating the unknown, softening fear, or preparing practically
- You desire to grieve with intention, not in isolation

> You don't need to be "ready."  
> You don't need to have the right words.  
> You just need to want something deeper, slower, and more honoring.
