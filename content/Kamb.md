## What is Kambô?

Kambô is a sacred medicine ethically harvested from the secretion of the Bicolour Tree Frog, native to the Amazon Rainforest. The secretion, known as Kambô, is rich in peptides—molecules that act as communicators for our hormones and help regulate various bodily functions.

#### **Why Use Kambô ?**

There are many reasons people choose to work with Kambô, both physically and energetically.

**Physical Benefits**: On a physical level, Kambô which is full of peptides which are very similar to our own, acts as a powerful booster to our system, travelling through the lymphatic system to restore the body to homeostasis. It boosts the immune system, helping to fight infections, viruses, injuries, and chronic illness. It helps balance our hormones which can support many things from our reproductive health to regulating our blood sugar levels.

**Energetic Benefits:** On a deeper, energetic level, Kambô works like a broom, sweeping away stagnant energy and emotional blockages. Think of it as collecting up what no longer serves you and clearing it away. Kambô can also reveal where we hold resistance and guide us toward the areas of our lives that need strengthening or healing. It brings clarity and insight, allowing us to confront and release what’s been holding us back. Kambô also allows us to move towards are goals, suddenly things feel much more simple after a Kambô session.

Often times we are so used to feeling groggy and achy, and perhaps low in energy; after we have experienced Kambô we feel almost superhuman.

Well, Kambô doesn't really give us super human powers- it can align us back into glorious homeostasis, which for many of us feels super human because of how used to feeling out of balance we have become.

#### **How is Kambô Applied?**

To access the lymphatic system, small, superficial burns (called “gates”) are made on the surface of the skin using a tool that resembles an incense stick. The Kambô secretion is then applied directly to these gates.

Our lymphatic system is incredibly responsive, and the effects of Kambô are usually felt within a minute. During a Kambô session, we drink up to 3 litres of water, which helps to support the medicine’s cleansing action and facilitate the purge (often through vomiting), further assisting the body in releasing toxins and stagnant energy.

**I am an[ IAKP](https://iakp.org/about-the-iakp/) trained  Kambô practitioner and I adhere to their safety standards and policies. **

I hold Kambô ceremonies in a more shamanic way using smokes and resins, and sound healing. The ceremony would last approximately 4 hours. You may need longer to rest after before going home or being left alone.

If you are called to have a Kambô ceremony, I will send you a medical questionnaire- it is important that you disclose all medical history past and present. While Kambo is very safe when practised by an experienced and knowledgeable and practitioner,  there are some conditions that Kambô is absolutely contraindicated for.

Please also disclose any prescription allopathic drugs, recreational drugs and plant/fungi/ amphibian medicine.

If this sounds good, the next step is to consider whether you would like to come to me, or have me make a house call to you. And the level of privacy you want.
