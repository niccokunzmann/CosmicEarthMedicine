1st Sunday of each month.

### Topic: üçÑ Micro-Dosing üçÑ

##### 1st one is Sunday 2nd at 1900-2030

Join me for 90 mins of micro dosing exploration. Bring your questions and curiosities.

We‚Äôll be sharing and discussing different protocols, dosing ways and how to work with sacred medicines.

We shall explore practices that can support your micro-dosing journey and   how to incorporate micro-dosing into your life.

Let‚Äôs also try to briefly look at the stigma associated with plant and fungi medicines!

In order to have a safe space to discuss this juicy practice, we will do group contracting at the beginning of the session.

So come ready to breathe deeply, relax and dive into the world of micro dosing.
