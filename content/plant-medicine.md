## Honoring the Shipibo Lineage & My Teacher Plant Marosa

My work is rooted in deep respect and connection to the Shipibo-Conibo lineage of the Peruvian
Amazon - a people who have carried and protected the sacred plant medicine traditions for countless generations.

Their relationship with the natural world is one of profound listening, discipline, and communion, and although I have been a student of plant and fungi medicines for over a decade, it is through this tradition that I have been most strongly guided and called on my own path of healing and service.

I have undertaken a plant dieta in the jungle under the care of my Maestro and his family. I dieted Marosa, a powerful revered master plant spirit known as the hospital of hospitals, the doctor of doctors. She is delicate and majestic, fiercely kind and deeply precise in her healing.

To dieta a plant or tree in this tradition is to enter a sacred agreement. Through fasting, isolation, silence, prayer, meditation, and ceremony, one commits to forming a direct relationship with the spirit of the plant or tree. Over time, this plant or tree ally begins to live within you - guiding, healing, and transforming.

Marosa now moves through me.
She dances through my hands as I channel healing energy, sound vibrations.
She sings through my voice in icaros, in chants, in whispers carried by shrutti or gong.
She guides my intuition and illuminates the subtle energies within each session.
Her medicine is woven into mine. As one.

This path is not mine alone - it is held in reciprocity and service.
10% of all my income goes directly to my Maestro Don Rono Lopez and his family, whose wisdom, care, and dedication make this work possible.
It is a small way of giving back to those who continue to hold these sacred teachings with such integrity and love.

Through Marosa, through the jungle, and through this lineage, I offer you my heart, my song, and my medicine.

In addition to my traditional training in the jungle, I am also studying psychedelic therapy at the University of Exeter, on a pioneering master's program. It deeply inspires me when modern science affirms what the plants have already shown me - validating ancient ways of knowing and making plant medicine healing more accessible, inclusive, and respected in the wider world.

You donâ€™t need to drink Ayahuasca to benefit from my plant dieta in our sessions together! 
However you choose to work with me, Marosa will help me to understand how I can best support you.
