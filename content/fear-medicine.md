# Experience the power of your fully undone self expression.

Magnetise the things you desire. (Pssst, you don‚Äôt have to need something. Desiring it IS enough)

Let your body drop the shame, the guilt, the fear of  asking for what you want and the fear of speaking about the things you are crazy passionate about.  

## From Fear to Fierce

This journey is for women and femmes.  Be activated, in the best ways, to step into your grown ass woman, integrate all your parts and dance with your freedom to create whatever it is you dream of creating. 
This is life artistry, beyond fear of failure, rejection, judgement‚Ä¶ 

This activation container is potent. Yes, I have a highly skilled tool box which I will use with you AND my energy will lovingly trigger your whole being into birthing the next versions of you into form.
Babe, I‚Äôm so excited to work with you on this! 

This is for you if:

- You are ready to be challenged. You are ready to be uncomfortable. Because levelling up is not usually completely comfortable! 
- You feel a big shift coming but you need help, you need to be in resonant energy with someone who has done the thing and is obsessed with helping others do the same! 
- You are listening to your body, to that mystery symptom or panic attack that crops up anytime you play small and choose not to go bold.
- Your journey of purpose has you walking that line of crazy, you feel like you are tight rope waking trying to stay up on the line when all you wanna do fling your self off it ‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs tempting and alluring but til now you have only ever dipped a toe in.. but you are now ready to cannon ball right in.. fully unhinged.
- You might have been called audacious. I was. As a girl and then more recently as a woman. I found that word shocking and kinda old school and I found myself giggling! Yes. Audacious. That‚Äôs me. 

I‚Äôm the woman who told my beloved who is a practical and functional minded and magical man, but very practical) ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt need to work to get money. All I need to do is sit under the Oak tree each morning at sunrise and meditate‚Äù. The way he looked at me.. his eyes flashed; Audacious. Brilliant‚Ä¶ wtf‚Ä¶ audacious. üòè
And no lie, I got a ching ching notification the first morning I did that‚Ä¶ at 5am!  And I haven‚Äôt looked back since.
