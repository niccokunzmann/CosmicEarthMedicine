> The use of Sacred Healing Frequencies to support, restore and stimulate health, healing and well-being. 

I use the resonant healing frequencies of my voice and sound tools to channel healing, restoration and harmony of body, mind, soul and spirit, to my clients. 

Everything vibrates. Each thing has a unique frequency, measured in Herz (Hz) which means the number of cycles something vibrates per second.

There are resonant healing frequencies like that which resonate out from nature like flowing water or from sound tools like gongs and sound bowls and our own voices. These can infuse our beings with nourishment and space to repair and restore our bodies to optimum health.

There are also irregular and constant dissonant and dis-easeful frequencies like those of our modern day electrical devices, wifi routers, sirens, alarms and traffic.

While many of us can’t escape the gadgets or the hustle and bustle, we will find Sound Medicine to be a supportive and empowering healing practice to receive in either in a bundle of 1:1 sessions and / or in a group sound bath. 

Sound can move stuck and stagnant energy from around the body. As we know from old ways of looking at energy or Chi within the body, blocked energy can result in dis-ease. Releasing this energy promotes and empowers health and wellness within our total being.

## 1:1 Sound Healing Sessions

Sound can touch us deeply, excavating things like buried stories, ancestral wounds and grief.
Within our 1:1 sessions I hold a safe, trauma informed, space for these tender stories and emotions to bubble up as the medium of sounds moves the energy towards release.
In our 1:1 sessions I offer you a bespoke sound healing experience;  We explore what sound tools would be most resonant with you and what you are looking to work on. Committing to a bundle of sessions means we can work with many sound tools and you will get to experience the unique way each tool resonates with your total being.

In some sessions I might offer a sonic massage- experiencing sound tools on your body. Other sessions you may experience sound resonating off the body only- both ways the sound will travel and vibrate in your auric fields.
See diagram 1. below..

## Group Sound Baths/Sound Journeys


Coming to a sound bath is a lovely way to dip your toes in to the healing power of Sacred Sound.
Receiving Sound Medicine within a group sound Journey or Bath is largely pleasurable to the senses. It’s a time out. Sometimes we can also drop into deep spaces during the Sound Bath. You shall be supported.

No sound bath is the same. I flow with the energies present at the time to channel a restorative sound journey for those who are on the mat. 
Because I delight in sensorial stimulation myself, I include smells like incense and essential oils so that we activate the olfactory senses too which can help memories surface. 

### Group Sound Journey Pricing

A Group Sound Bath/Journey costs £20 per person.
I hold group sessions regularly in Carmarthenshire and the Cardiff area.
