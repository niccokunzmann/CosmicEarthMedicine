> Tailored Sound Healing Experience

>

> Sound has a profound ability to touch us deeply, unearthing buried stories, ancestral wounds, and unresolved grief. In our 1:1 sound healing sessions, I create a safe, trauma-informed space where these tender emotions and memories can surface, allowing the healing power of sound to move and release stagnant energy.

>

> Each session is a bespoke experience, tailored to your unique needs. Together, we’ll explore which sound tools resonate most with you and what areas you wish to focus on. Committing to a series of sessions allows us to work with a variety of sound tools, giving you the opportunity to experience the distinct ways each one interacts with your body, mind, and spirit.

>

> Depending on the session, you may receive a sonic massage, where sound tools are applied directly to your body, or you may experience sound resonating through your auric field, vibrating and shifting your energy from the outside in. Both methods are deeply effective in facilitating healing and transformation.

>

### Group Sound Bath

Join a Regular Sound  Bath / Journey

My regular sound baths in Carmarthenshire and Cardiff offer a wonderful opportunity to experience the healing power of Sacred Sound. These sessions are a perfect introduction to Sound Medicine, allowing you to immerse yourself in the transformative energy of sound within a group setting.

A sound bath is deeply pleasurable for the senses and offers a welcome “time out” from the busyness of life. While the experience is usually soothing, it can also guide you into deeper states of relaxation and healing. No two sound baths are the same; I flow with the energy of the group and the space to create a restorative sound journey tailored to those present.

In addition to sound, I love incorporating other sensory elements, such as incense and essential oils, to activate the olfactory senses. This multisensory approach helps deepen the experience and can even encourage memories and emotions to surface.
