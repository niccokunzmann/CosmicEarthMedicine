## Whispers of sound

Wispers of sound is a sound healing ceremony made just for you: 1:1 Sound Healing Sessions.
A Return to Resonance~
Journey Through Sound, Memory & Body

Sound is an ancient language of remembering.
It speaks to what lives beneath words -
touching the places where emotion, energy, and memory gather in silence.
Sound has the power to unearth what's been buried:
ancestral grief, inherited tension, the stories held deep in the marrow.
In these one-to-one sessions, I offer a grounded, trauma-informed space where your body can safely open to the medicine of sound - gently, powerfully, and on your own terms.

### Rooted & Intuitive Support

Each session is a bespoke experience, attuned to the rhythm of your body and the needs of your spirit.
We begin by listening - to you, your energy, your intentions.
Together, we'll explore which sound tools feel most resonant - from ancient tones to elemental frequencies.
Some sessions may include a sonic massage, with instruments applied directly to your body - gently vibrating the tissues, shifting tension, moving energy from the inside out.
Other times, we'll work within the auric field, using sound to touch what is felt but unseen - subtle, yet deeply transformative.

These sessions honour both vour human story and your ancestral roots -
calling in sound as a bridge between your inner and outer worlds.

## Group Sound Journeys

{{< figure src="/img/yemaya-sound-bath.jpg" title="Sacred Sound in Circle" caption="A Multisensory Ceremony of Remembering. Step out of the noise of daily life and into a field of vibration, rest, and resonance." >}}

My regular sound journeys in Carmarthenshire and Cardiff are an invitation to drop into deep presence,
held gently in community and ceremony.
These are more than sound baths - they are gatherings for the soul.

Rooted in ancient remembering, guided by intuition, and shaped by the energy of the circle, each session is a living, breathing soundscape: no two are ever the same.

### What to Expect

As we settle into the space, the senses begin to soften.
You may be welcomed with sacred smoke - Mapacho, Paulo Santo, Sage -
or anointing oils that help clear the energetic field and open the heart.
Then, with breath and stillness, we begin.
You'll be immersed in layers of sacred sound -
voice, bowls, drums, gongs, rattles
-weaving through the space and touching the subtle places within.
The sounds may soothe or stir, invite rest or evoke release.
Some journeys are gentle, others deeply moving - always what is needed.

This is sound as medicine, sound as remembrance.
A chance to come home to yourself, to reconnect with your body, to feel yourself held in the resonance of shared healing.

### Who It's For

These sound journeys are open to all - no experience needed.
Whether you're curious, called, or simply seeking rest, you're welcome here.  
Come as you are.  
Lie down.  
Let the sound hold what words cannot.
