## Ritual Doula: Full Journey

Package £1,700 -£2,200 sliding scale
In-person only. Birth Cover and 7 Sessions Total
(5 Prenatal and 2 Postpartum)

This offering is an intimate, ceremonial pathway created for mothers seeking not only support but deep teachings on ritual and spiritual birth preparation.

This Ritual Doula Package is a deeply embodied 1:1 journey that spans five prenatal sessions and two postpartum ceremonies, held entirely in person. It is a sacred weaving of traditional midwifery wisdom, energy healing, guided meditation, bodywork, prayer, nature immersions, connection and sharing.

Each session moves through a medicine wheel of the elements, guiding you into spiritual preparation for birth and a rooted return in postpartum. Together we activate ancestral connection, soften the body with rebozo and breath, walk through water cleansing and fire prayer, call in your soul, and craft your altar and birth mantra. 
We share prayer, we connect, we refine your birth plan and expand your visions and manifestations for birth calling in the divine to support your every step. 

I will be on call 10 days before the estimated due date until the birth of your baby. I will show up as a sister, a friend,  in love and as a fierce protector of your family’s birthing space.

Of course, ongoing WhatsApp/text check-ins are available during the time we walk together.

## Post Partum Support

During each post partum visit you receive a nourishing meal with two portions.

After birth, we navigate the mother threshold with tenderness--creating sacred space for placenta medicine, processing birth, womb healing, and the ancient Closing of the Bones ritual with hot oil, herbs, prayer and cacao.

This is for the woman who wants to introduce deep rooted traditional birth ceremonies into her journey.

Reach out to me and we will schedule a free in person or online meeting to see if this connection is in alignment for you.

Payment plans are available. 
Sliding scale: Choose what feels right within the range based on your resources.

Birth attendance is limited to those who walk with me for the ceremony of pregnancy. 

If you would like to co-create a bespoke package of more or less sessions together, let’s talk! 

If you are seeking rooted support for any kind of baby loss please reach out, and be met with loving, tender and non-judgemental care and attention.
