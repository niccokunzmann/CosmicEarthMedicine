                        <h4>
                            Hi my name is Yemaya. I am a mother and medicine woman - woven of many roots, carried in my body, in my voice and in the way I hold space for healing.
                        </h4>
                        <p>
                            I walk with stories — told and untold, spoken and held in stillness. Each one lives in my bones, a thread in the fabric of who I am.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Birth, death, healing, sound, body; different languages for the same prayer. 
                            I walk with people as they rise, unravel, remember, as they open, unlearn and release.
                            As they meet life in its rawest, most sacred forms.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I am a birth-keeper<br/>
I am a loving witness to the dying<br/>
I am a sound practitioner<br/>
I am an energy healer<br/>
I am an occupational therapist<br/>
I am a fear medicine mentor
                        </p>
                            <p>
                            I am a ceremonialist 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Each role is a strand in the braid. I make no separation between them. 
Each one meets the body where it trembles and the soul where it sings.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I walk with people through life's thresholds;
from womb to deathbed, from trauma to truth, from silence to sound.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            All of it is ceremony.
All of it is holy.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            
You do not need to arrive perfect.
You only need to arrive willing.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            My work is remembrance. A returning to what the earth knows, to what the ancestors still whisper. It rises from a place beyond language — rooted in soil, in spirit, in breath.
                            I create spaces where truth can soften, where the body can speak, where we are invited to remember ourselves whole, where we can choose the quiet courage of self-responsibility and where we can rest into the deep embrace of self-acceptance.
