                        <h4>
                            Hi my name is Yemaya. 
                            I am a brown woman,
                            woven of many roots, carried in my body, in my sound, in the way I hold space for healing.
                        </h4>
                        <p>
                            I walk with stories —
                            told and untold,
                            spoken and held in stillness.
                            Each one lives in my bones,
                            a thread in the fabric of who I am.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            My sound work is not performance.
                            It is remembrance.
                            A returning to what the earth knows,
                            to what the ancestors still whisper.
                            It rises from a place beyond language —
                            rooted in soil, in spirit, in breath.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This is the work I carry:
                            to create spaces where truth can soften,
                            where the body can speak,
                            where we are invited to remember ourselves whole, where we can choose the quiet courage of self-responsibility and where we can rest into the deep embrace of self-acceptance.
                        </p>
